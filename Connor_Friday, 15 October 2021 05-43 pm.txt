The Lover 
 
The Lovers card is representative not only of  
crucial life choices, but also of lovers, couples, and other  
partnerships, like business partners, twins, friends etc. The  
young man between two women, depicted on this card, is symbolic  
for the struggle of trying to decide whether to follow ones  
heart or ones temptation/obligation. The Lovers card symbolizes  
the choices that must be made to progress and grow on the way  
to higher self-awareness; choices also reflect emotional  
values, indecisiveness, hesitation, our fears about making the  
wrong choice. This applies not only to love relationships and  
marriages, it is applicable to any relationship where people  
may be drawn together be it a business partnership or a casual,  
recreational one. The card of uncertainty!

The World 
 
The World card, regarded as the best card in the  
major arcana is a symbol for all that we can accomplish on our  
path through life, for perfection, beauty, success, and public  
recognition. This is where the cycle ends and begins again.  
Happiness and wholeness are key elements that provide a sense  
of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Signaling  
accomplishment and reaching of one's goals the World card makes  
us aware that in completing this cycle we are ready to embark  
on a new adventure. We are prepared and preparing for another  
journey with higher awareness, knowing that active engagement  
and service are called for. In a negative situation this card  
can point to major obstacles in our path, to set backs, to  
loose ends we have left untied as well as lack of commitment.

Judgement 
 
The Judgement card represents the judgment day or  
awakening call heralding a rite of passage. As one cycle comes  
to an end we need to prepare for a new stage in our  
development, the future is waiting. Now is the time when past  
efforts yield positive results, when we can reap the rewards,  
when we realize that we are drawn in a new direction and  
recognize our true calling. In it's positive meaning the  
Judgement card reminds us that through honesty and true  
reflection we can realize where we have erred on our path and  
that we need to forgive ourselves to regain a feeling of  
self-worth and accomplishment. Placed in a negative situation

regret, and imbalance, imprisonment.

The Devil 
 
The card of the Devil represents the darker side  
of humankind, all that we is shameful and base and that we  
avoid to confront. Its imagery connects to sexuality,  
irrationality, obsession, and addiction. Being enslaved by our  
fears and desires we find it hard to let go of unhealthy  
relationships, addictive behavior, excessive attachment to  
material things, obsession with power. Accepting the shadowy  
side in us can help channel the energetic powers that this card  
also represents. Understanding, that the chains that tie us  
down can indeed be lifted by confronting our dark side, and not  
letting self-hatred and shame take over empowers us to be free.  
Qualities of this card in a negative situation include  
excessive ambition, rigidity, and abuse of power in the  
emotional as well as the material realm.

Love and Romance

The Emperor 
 
As the complement to the Empress, the Emperor  
represents the father figure, reigning through wisdom, order,  
authority, power, and control. Thus he embodies the material  
world, structure, and order, and balances the Empress'  
abundance and pure instinct. His stable leadership and  
authority are not to be questioned. The Emperor reminds us that  
rational thought, willpower, and fearlessness yield recognition  
and achievement in general. Through strength he creates and  
builds, material things, families, communities, and gives them  
structure, projects are put on a solid foundation. On an  
emotional level this card symbolizes confirming of established  
feelings, tightening of links among beings, and self-respect.  
In a negative situation this card can mean despotism, tyranny,  
self-righteousness, and hampering of any progress.

The Empress 
 
The Empress signifies the queen of life, the  
perfect woman, the archetypal mother. She represents the  
matriarchal goddess, being part of nature, fertility,  
sexuality, and the generative forces. As the life-giving mother  
she is connected to the Earth and the natural rhythms, the  
appreciation of the senses. As a card of good fortune she  
signifies that if we are gentle and caring, as well as patient  
we can bring anything to fruition; we have to be able to wait  
until the time is right for action so that we can reap the  
rewards, hard work pays off and relationships become  
satisfying. The Empress can, in negative situations, also  
depict vanity, undeveloped creativity, stagnation, and apathy.

VII. House 
Your Social Life and 
Relationships

The Chariot 
 
The Chariot symbolizes enthusiasm, competitiveness, and triumph. 
Success and victory are achieved by employing all powers at his  
disposal, physical, spiritual, and intellectual. The positive  
sides of the self, being strong and self-controlled, balancing  
conflicting emotions, triumphing over obstacles, and sustaining  
an effort, support attaining goals, thereby leading the way to  
transformation and self-knowledge. A dictatorial approach,  
recklessness, and extreme ambition can be on the other,  
negative, side of the equation.

Transformations

The Magician 
 
As the archetype of the masculine principle, the  
Magician represents someone who is able to achieve his goals  
through his creative abilities and his skills in using the  
tools available to him. The Magician symbolizes the beginning  
of something when everything is possible. It can be a start of  
a new relationship, the birth of a new idea or creative  
project, or a financial strategy. The Magician is a confident  
person realizing his full potential by taking positive action  
and focusing his attention and energies to the task at hand.  
This includes employing magic. On the negative side the  
Magician represents egotism, treachery, and overconfidence,  
thereby misleading others into making wrong choices.

The Hanged Man 
 
The Hanged Man is an unsettling, mysterious card,  
because it symbolizes the reversal of our life situations, all  
contradictions we face in ourselves and in life in general,  
paradox in action. Although the Hanged Man seems restricted and  
helpless, he looks calm and relaxed. In this position the card  
represents the rational mind being turned off, acceptance of a  
new situation, a unique point of view, reflection and serenity.  
Deeply thoughtful he seems to have reached a higher  
consciousness. By letting go and giving up, as painful as it  
may be, this symbolism suggests that we can overcome  
restrictions, find what we have been looking for, and  
ultimately become free, self-determined beings. In a negative  
setting the symbolism suggests manipulation, passivity, useless  
sacrifice, and apathy.

X. House 
Your Ambitions, Skills 
and Capacities

The Moon 
 
The Moon in all its phases represents the world of  
dreams, illusions, and the subconscious. Traditionally the  
symbol of the feminine, the card's meaning encompasses the  
maternal, the Great Mother, womanhood, and cycles. The Moon is  
an ambivalent card, its imagery signifies the difficulty to see  
things clearly: inspiring and lacking courage, enchanting and  
bewildering, deceptive and receptive - all sides of the same  
coin. Signaling fluctuating moods and uncertainty we must pay  
attention to our dreams, confront our subconscious and deal  
with the issues that come to the surface in order to progress  
to a higher level of awareness. Being able to put our  
imagination and creative talents to good use is an added bonus.  
Negative qualities, such as ambiguity, confusion, hidden fears,  
deception, can be a cause for failure.

Strengths and Supports

The Sun 
 
The Sun card stands as a symbol for the paternal,  
masculine energy, the cosmic father, and brotherly love. Being  
regarded as the primary source of life, light, and warmth, the  
sun banishes the darkness so that we may see our path clearly  
and are enlightened within, meaning that we can see the truth  
and understand its impact. The Sun card is representative of  
energy, good health, virility, opportunity, generosity,  
self-confidence, success, marriage, children, and material  
wealth. These positive elements provide us with the confidence  
that we will be successful in all our endeavors, be it in the  
spiritual, material, or emotional realm. We need to be aware of  
the negative elements, like boisterousness, arrogance, vanity,  
and false appearance that can induce failure and uncertainty.

XII. House 
Obstacles and 
Challenges

Death 
 
Initially a nameless card, Death very seldom  
literally means death. Instead it is the image of profound  
transformation, the ending of one cycle, and the transition  
into a new state. It symbolizes sudden and inevitable change,  
death of the old self so that the new consciousness can emerge.  
The experience can be saddening or painful and we might be  
reluctant to accept the inevitability of the ending. To accept  
and recognize the necessity of endings, liberates and allows  
for inner change, rebirth, and renewal. The negative  
interpretation is depression due to neglecting that a cycle has  
come to an end, break-up of relationships, obsession, and  
stagnation.
