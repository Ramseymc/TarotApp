The High Priestess

The mysterious High Priestess jealously guards her 
secrets and occult wisdom. This card symbolizes the 
unconscious, a concern with our internal worlds, spiritual 
forces, and the understanding of higher truths through dreams 
and intuition. As a wise woman the High Priestess is the 
Goddess of fertility and is seen as a healer, possessing 
intuitive powers, and clairvoyance, trying to create harmony 
and inner balance. She emphasizes the necessity to get in 
contact with our inner self, to reflect and meditate, to trust 
our feelings, and to let dreams and intuition guide us. 
Observing rather than participating or acting the High 
Priestess can also represent platonic love, manipulation, a 
pause in a process that was progressing or even a standstill, 
causing doubt and confusion.
