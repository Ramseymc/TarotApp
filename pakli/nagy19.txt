The Moon

The Moon in all its phases represents the world of 
dreams, illusions, and the subconscious. Traditionally the 
symbol of the feminine, the card's meaning encompasses the 
maternal, the Great Mother, womanhood, and cycles. The Moon is 
an ambivalent card, its imagery signifies the difficulty to see 
things clearly: inspiring and lacking courage, enchanting and 
bewildering, deceptive and receptive - all sides of the same 
coin. Signaling fluctuating moods and uncertainty we must pay 
attention to our dreams, confront our subconscious and deal 
with the issues that come to the surface in order to progress 
to a higher level of awareness. Being able to put our 
imagination and creative talents to good use is an added bonus. 
Negative qualities, such as ambiguity, confusion, hidden fears, 
deception, can be a cause for failure.
