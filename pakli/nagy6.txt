The Pope

As a priest, the Pope represents traditional 
values and moral development. He is the wise teacher or 
counselor guiding groups or collectives on their path in search 
for spiritual truth or meaning.
Depicted as a religious figure in ceremonial vestments he 
interprets secret mysteries, divine law, and theological 
doctrine. Although this card describes that he is linked to the 
church, the Pope signifies not only organized religion but also 
focus on groups in general, such as schools, teams, companies, 
any group with fixed roles and assigned responsibilities. The 
Pope is a symbol for rules, procedures, structure, and ritual, 
creating harmony within groups and staying their course so they 
can find identity and progress as a whole. The negative imagery 
symbolizes dogmatism and inflexibility, extreme conformity, or 
conventionalism.
