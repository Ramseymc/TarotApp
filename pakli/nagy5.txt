The Emperor

As the complement to the Empress, the Emperor 
represents the father figure, reigning through wisdom, order, 
authority, power, and control. Thus he embodies the material 
world, structure, and order, and balances the Empress' 
abundance and pure instinct. His stable leadership and 
authority are not to be questioned. The Emperor reminds us that 
rational thought, willpower, and fearlessness yield recognition 
and achievement in general. Through strength he creates and 
builds, material things, families, communities, and gives them 
structure, projects are put on a solid foundation. On an 
emotional level this card symbolizes confirming of established 
feelings, tightening of links among beings, and self-respect. 
In a negative situation this card can mean despotism, tyranny, 
self-righteousness, and hampering of any progress.
