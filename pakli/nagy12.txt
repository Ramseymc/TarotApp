Justice

Based on the realization that life is ultimately 
fair and just, the Justice card symbolizes balance, harmony, 
and fairness in our lives. She represents the choices we make, 
and reminds us to base them on planning, reflection, 
rationality, and a weighing of options between the sword and 
the scales. In love relationships this is reflected by honesty, 
respect, and loyalty, in professional life by essential values 
like professionalism, respect for established processes and 
procedures and adherence to reporting systems. In negative 
situations this card can resemble imbalance, coldness, and a 
destructive streak impeding relationships.
