The Magician

As the archetype of the masculine principle, the 
Magician represents someone who is able to achieve his goals 
through his creative abilities and his skills in using the 
tools available to him. The Magician symbolizes the beginning 
of something when everything is possible. It can be a start of 
a new relationship, the birth of a new idea or creative 
project, or a financial strategy. The Magician is a confident 
person realizing his full potential by taking positive action 
and focusing his attention and energies to the task at hand. 
This includes employing magic. On the negative side the 
Magician represents egotism, treachery, and overconfidence, 
thereby misleading others into making wrong choices.
