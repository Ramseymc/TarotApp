The Sun

The Sun card stands as a symbol for the paternal, 
masculine energy, the cosmic father, and brotherly love. Being 
regarded as the primary source of life, light, and warmth, the 
sun banishes the darkness so that we may see our path clearly 
and are enlightened within, meaning that we can see the truth 
and understand its impact. The Sun card is representative of 
energy, good health, virility, opportunity, generosity, 
self-confidence, success, marriage, children, and material 
wealth. These positive elements provide us with the confidence 
that we will be successful in all our endeavors, be it in the 
spiritual, material, or emotional realm. We need to be aware of 
the negative elements, like boisterousness, arrogance, vanity, 
and false appearance that can induce failure and uncertainty.
