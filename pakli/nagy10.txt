The Hermit

The Hermit card symbolizes meditation, reflection,
and solitude. As one of the cards resembling old age it also
represents bearing the light of wisdom, looking into the 
unconscious, observing dreams. There is an emphasis on peace 
and patience, by which maturity is reached, and a striving to 
connect to the higher spiritual self. The Hermit also depicts 
the spiritual leader, the taskmaster who leads with purpose, 
conscience, and wisdom. A mature person, the Hermit symbolizes 
deliberation about which path to follow, reassessment of 
achievements and goals, and taking the time to reflect and 
plan. In a negative environment this card can resemble 
excessive isolation, lack of communication, intolerance, crisis 
and doubt.
