The Chariot

The Chariot symbolizes enthusiasm, competitiveness, and triumph.
Success and victory are achieved by employing all powers at his 
disposal, physical, spiritual, and intellectual. The positive 
sides of the self, being strong and self-controlled, balancing 
conflicting emotions, triumphing over obstacles, and sustaining 
an effort, support attaining goals, thereby leading the way to 
transformation and self-knowledge. A dictatorial approach, 
recklessness, and extreme ambition can be on the other, 
negative, side of the equation.
