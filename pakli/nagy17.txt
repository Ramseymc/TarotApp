The Tower

The Tower card first and foremost illustrates that 
neither physical nor emotional structures that we build are 
permanent and stable instead they can be destroyed suddenly, 
thereby initiating change that we tried to avoid. The sudden 
change resembled by the crumbling tower reminds us of letting 
go of outgrown beliefs and values, of letting go of an 
illusion, an unhealthy relationship, an old way of life. The 
sudden change frees us to face the unknown, frees us to move 
forward instead of stagnate, frees us from social conventions 
and enlightens us on our path so that we reach a new level of 
understanding about our purpose in life. Not embracing the 
inevitable change brings out the negative elements that the 
Tower also depicts, being struck down by one's own doing, by 
vanity and the inability to change so that one remains stagnant.
