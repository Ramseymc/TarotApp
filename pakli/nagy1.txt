The Fool

The Fool is the card without a number. It usually 
is positioned at the beginning of the major arcana but can be 
either at the beginning or the end as it depicts our learning 
experience through life from beginning to end. The Fool 
signifies one's potential and abilities. Embarking on his 
journey toward self-knowledge, the Fool is at the same time 
adventurous and fearful, seemingly open to all possibilities, 
yet apparently unaware of the dangers along the way. Irrational 
impulses, foolishness, and poor judgment are some of the 
negative aspects of this card. At the end of his journey the 
Fool has learned life's lessons and is aware of his place in 
the world and in one with himself.
