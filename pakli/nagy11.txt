Wheel of Fortune

The Wheel of Fortune symbolizes 
the ever-changing cycle of life, wins and losses, ups and 
downs, unexpected luck, advancements and set backs, success and 
failure - the duality of things. Representing a breakthrough, a 
fortunate set of circumstances, the energies of the turning 
wheel also suggest incalculability, chance, surprise, rapid 
change and fate ending problematic times, heralding good 
fortune, and stimulating development and growth. As one of the 
cards not showing a human figure at its center, the Wheel of 
Fortune represents our uncovering of life's cycles and 
patterns, the discovery of our purpose in life, and the 
realization that nothing is permanent, everything is always in 
flux. In a negative situation the card can resemble failure, 
misfortune, gambling excess, and a turn for the worse.
