The High Priestess 
 
The mysterious High Priestess jealously guards her  
secrets and occult wisdom. This card symbolizes the  
unconscious, a concern with our internal worlds, spiritual  
forces, and the understanding of higher truths through dreams  
and intuition. As a wise woman the High Priestess is the  
Goddess of fertility and is seen as a healer, possessing  
intuitive powers, and clairvoyance, trying to create harmony  
and inner balance. She emphasizes the necessity to get in  
contact with our inner self, to reflect and meditate, to trust  
our feelings, and to let dreams and intuition guide us.  
Observing rather than participating or acting the High  
Priestess can also represent platonic love, manipulation, a  
pause in a process that was progressing or even a standstill,  
causing doubt and confusion.

The Sun 
 
The Sun card stands as a symbol for the paternal,  
masculine energy, the cosmic father, and brotherly love. Being  
regarded as the primary source of life, light, and warmth, the  
sun banishes the darkness so that we may see our path clearly  
and are enlightened within, meaning that we can see the truth  
and understand its impact. The Sun card is representative of  
energy, good health, virility, opportunity, generosity,  
self-confidence, success, marriage, children, and material  
wealth. These positive elements provide us with the confidence  
that we will be successful in all our endeavors, be it in the  
spiritual, material, or emotional realm. We need to be aware of  
the negative elements, like boisterousness, arrogance, vanity,  
and false appearance that can induce failure and uncertainty.

The Empress 
 
The Empress signifies the queen of life, the  
perfect woman, the archetypal mother. She represents the  
matriarchal goddess, being part of nature, fertility,  
sexuality, and the generative forces. As the life-giving mother  
she is connected to the Earth and the natural rhythms, the  
appreciation of the senses. As a card of good fortune she  
signifies that if we are gentle and caring, as well as patient  
we can bring anything to fruition; we have to be able to wait  
until the time is right for action so that we can reap the  
rewards, hard work pays off and relationships become  
satisfying. The Empress can, in negative situations, also  
depict vanity, undeveloped creativity, stagnation, and apathy.

The World 
 
The World card, regarded as the best card in the  
major arcana is a symbol for all that we can accomplish on our  
path through life, for perfection, beauty, success, and public  
recognition. This is where the cycle ends and begins again.  
Happiness and wholeness are key elements that provide a sense  
of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Signaling  
accomplishment and reaching of one's goals the World card makes  
us aware that in completing this cycle we are ready to embark  
on a new adventure. We are prepared and preparing for another  
journey with higher awareness, knowing that active engagement  
and service are called for. In a negative situation this card

loose ends we have left untied as well as lack of commitment.

Love and Romance

The Chariot 
 
The Chariot symbolizes enthusiasm, competitiveness, and triumph. 
Success and victory are achieved by employing all powers at his  
disposal, physical, spiritual, and intellectual. The positive  
sides of the self, being strong and self-controlled, balancing  
conflicting emotions, triumphing over obstacles, and sustaining  
an effort, support attaining goals, thereby leading the way to  
transformation and self-knowledge. A dictatorial approach,  
recklessness, and extreme ambition can be on the other,  
negative, side of the equation.

The Devil 
 
The card of the Devil represents the darker side  
of humankind, all that we is shameful and base and that we  
avoid to confront. Its imagery connects to sexuality,  
irrationality, obsession, and addiction. Being enslaved by our  
fears and desires we find it hard to let go of unhealthy  
relationships, addictive behavior, excessive attachment to  
material things, obsession with power. Accepting the shadowy  
side in us can help channel the energetic powers that this card  
also represents. Understanding, that the chains that tie us  
down can indeed be lifted by confronting our dark side, and not  
letting self-hatred and shame take over empowers us to be free.  
Qualities of this card in a negative situation include  
excessive ambition, rigidity, and abuse of power in the  
emotional as well as the material realm.

represents bearing the light of wisdom, looking into the  
unconscious, observing dreams. There is an emphasis on peace  
and patience, by which maturity is reached, and a striving to  
connect to the higher spiritual self. The Hermit also depicts  
the spiritual leader, the taskmaster who leads with purpose,  
conscience, and wisdom. A mature person, the Hermit symbolizes  
deliberation about which path to follow, reassessment of  
achievements and goals, and taking the time to reflect and  
plan. In a negative environment this card can resemble  
excessive isolation, lack of communication, intolerance, crisis  
and doubt.

The Pope 
 
As a priest, the Pope represents traditional  
values and moral development. He is the wise teacher or  
counselor guiding groups or collectives on their path in search  
for spiritual truth or meaning. 
Depicted as a religious figure in ceremonial vestments he  
interprets secret mysteries, divine law, and theological  
doctrine. Although this card describes that he is linked to the  
church, the Pope signifies not only organized religion but also  
focus on groups in general, such as schools, teams, companies,  
any group with fixed roles and assigned responsibilities. The  
Pope is a symbol for rules, procedures, structure, and ritual,  
creating harmony within groups and staying their course so they  
can find identity and progress as a whole. The negative imagery  
symbolizes dogmatism and inflexibility, extreme conformity, or  
conventionalism.

Temperance 
 
The Angel between heaven and earth blending  
different elements into a harmonious substance represents a  
bridge between polarities like heaven and earth, masculine and  
feminine, beginning and end. The combining of varied substances  
serves as imagery for the merging of diverse forces to create a  
new whole, for cooperation, coordination, a harmonious balance,  
looking for a middle ground, achieving healing, and recovery.  
Temperance signifies that moderation is necessary to modify  
passions and maintain harmony in relationships, and to build on  
tolerance and cooperation in groups. In a negative situation,

and Capacities

The Star 
 
The Star, being one of the very positive cards of  
the Tarot, reminds us of hope and inspiration. The Star is the  
symbol for our faith in the future, for feeling guided on our  
path by its calm and serene light. As we can feel confident to  
not lose our direction, we regain motivation and inner strength  
and can experience peace of mind. The Star protects the future  
and gathers the forces necessary to expand our knowledge and  
develop emotionally and spiritually. The sense of protection,  
promise, inspiration, and joy encourages us to develop our  
talents to achieve our ideals. Even in an unfavorable situation  
the negative elements merely throw obstacles in our way, like  
pessimism, a lack of realism, or the inability to accept a  
helping hand, thus leading to possible failure.

The Emperor 
 
As the complement to the Empress, the Emperor  
represents the father figure, reigning through wisdom, order,  
authority, power, and control. Thus he embodies the material  
world, structure, and order, and balances the Empress'  
abundance and pure instinct. His stable leadership and  
authority are not to be questioned. The Emperor reminds us that  
rational thought, willpower, and fearlessness yield recognition  
and achievement in general. Through strength he creates and  
builds, material things, families, communities, and gives them  
structure, projects are put on a solid foundation. On an  
emotional level this card symbolizes confirming of established  
feelings, tightening of links among beings, and self-respect.  
In a negative situation this card can mean despotism, tyranny,  
self-righteousness, and hampering of any progress.

The Magician 
 
As the archetype of the masculine principle, the  
Magician represents someone who is able to achieve his goals  
through his creative abilities and his skills in using the  
tools available to him. The Magician symbolizes the beginning  
of something when everything is possible. It can be a start of  
a new relationship, the birth of a new idea or creative  
project, or a financial strategy. The Magician is a confident  
person realizing his full potential by taking positive action  
and focusing his attention and energies to the task at hand.  
This includes employing magic. On the negative side the  
Magician represents egotism, treachery, and overconfidence,  
thereby misleading others into making wrong choices.
