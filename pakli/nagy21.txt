Judgement

The Judgement card represents the judgment day or 
awakening call heralding a rite of passage. As one cycle comes 
to an end we need to prepare for a new stage in our 
development, the future is waiting. Now is the time when past 
efforts yield positive results, when we can reap the rewards, 
when we realize that we are drawn in a new direction and 
recognize our true calling. In it's positive meaning the 
Judgement card reminds us that through honesty and true 
reflection we can realize where we have erred on our path and 
that we need to forgive ourselves to regain a feeling of 
self-worth and accomplishment. Placed in a negative situation 
Judgement symbolizes indecision, a fear of letting go, remorse, 
regret, and imbalance, imprisonment.
