Death

Initially a nameless card, Death very seldom 
literally means death. Instead it is the image of profound 
transformation, the ending of one cycle, and the transition 
into a new state. It symbolizes sudden and inevitable change, 
death of the old self so that the new consciousness can emerge. 
The experience can be saddening or painful and we might be 
reluctant to accept the inevitability of the ending. To accept 
and recognize the necessity of endings, liberates and allows 
for inner change, rebirth, and renewal. The negative 
interpretation is depression due to neglecting that a cycle has 
come to an end, break-up of relationships, obsession, and 
stagnation.
