Temperance

The Angel between heaven and earth blending 
different elements into a harmonious substance represents a 
bridge between polarities like heaven and earth, masculine and 
feminine, beginning and end. The combining of varied substances 
serves as imagery for the merging of diverse forces to create a 
new whole, for cooperation, coordination, a harmonious balance, 
looking for a middle ground, achieving healing, and recovery. 
Temperance signifies that moderation is necessary to modify 
passions and maintain harmony in relationships, and to build on 
tolerance and cooperation in groups. In a negative situation, 
Temperance characteristics are indecision, inconstancy, excess, 
obsession, and lack of control.
