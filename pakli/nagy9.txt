Strength

The Strength card, depicting a gracious queen-like 
figure and a wild lion, shows that real strength has to be 
combined with graciousness and gentleness to become a force. It 
symbolizes inner strength, determination to overcome obstacles, 
self-knowledge and self-discipline, as only when we know 
ourselves and act in a responsible manner will we be able to 
deal with challenging situations and overcome difficulties 
successfully. Yet this card does not only represent physical 
strength, moral and emotional strength are included in the 
meaning. Patience, compassion, dealing with frustration, 
accepting of others, tolerating imperfection (in oneself and in 
others), all leads to being a complete person. The negative 
qualities of Strength include misuse of power, aggressiveness, 
and intolerance.
