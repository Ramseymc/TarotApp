The Hanged Man

The Hanged Man is an unsettling, mysterious card, 
because it symbolizes the reversal of our life situations, all 
contradictions we face in ourselves and in life in general, 
paradox in action. Although the Hanged Man seems restricted and 
helpless, he looks calm and relaxed. In this position the card 
represents the rational mind being turned off, acceptance of a 
new situation, a unique point of view, reflection and serenity. 
Deeply thoughtful he seems to have reached a higher 
consciousness. By letting go and giving up, as painful as it 
may be, this symbolism suggests that we can overcome 
restrictions, find what we have been looking for, and 
ultimately become free, self-determined beings. In a negative 
setting the symbolism suggests manipulation, passivity, useless 
sacrifice, and apathy.
