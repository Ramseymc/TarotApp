The Star

The Star, being one of the very positive cards of 
the Tarot, reminds us of hope and inspiration. The Star is the 
symbol for our faith in the future, for feeling guided on our 
path by its calm and serene light. As we can feel confident to 
not lose our direction, we regain motivation and inner strength 
and can experience peace of mind. The Star protects the future 
and gathers the forces necessary to expand our knowledge and 
develop emotionally and spiritually. The sense of protection, 
promise, inspiration, and joy encourages us to develop our 
talents to achieve our ideals. Even in an unfavorable situation 
the negative elements merely throw obstacles in our way, like 
pessimism, a lack of realism, or the inability to accept a 
helping hand, thus leading to possible failure.
