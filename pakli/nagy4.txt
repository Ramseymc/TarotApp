The Empress

The Empress signifies the queen of life, the 
perfect woman, the archetypal mother. She represents the 
matriarchal goddess, being part of nature, fertility, 
sexuality, and the generative forces. As the life-giving mother 
she is connected to the Earth and the natural rhythms, the 
appreciation of the senses. As a card of good fortune she 
signifies that if we are gentle and caring, as well as patient 
we can bring anything to fruition; we have to be able to wait 
until the time is right for action so that we can reap the 
rewards, hard work pays off and relationships become 
satisfying. The Empress can, in negative situations, also 
depict vanity, undeveloped creativity, stagnation, and apathy.
