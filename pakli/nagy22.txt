The World

The World card, regarded as the best card in the 
major arcana is a symbol for all that we can accomplish on our 
path through life, for perfection, beauty, success, and public 
recognition. This is where the cycle ends and begins again. 
Happiness and wholeness are key elements that provide a sense 
of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Signaling 
accomplishment and reaching of one's goals the World card makes 
us aware that in completing this cycle we are ready to embark 
on a new adventure. We are prepared and preparing for another 
journey with higher awareness, knowing that active engagement 
and service are called for. In a negative situation this card 
can point to major obstacles in our path, to set backs, to 
loose ends we have left untied as well as lack of commitment.
