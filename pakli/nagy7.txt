The Lover

The Lovers card is representative not only of 
crucial life choices, but also of lovers, couples, and other 
partnerships, like business partners, twins, friends etc. The 
young man between two women, depicted on this card, is symbolic 
for the struggle of trying to decide whether to follow ones 
heart or ones temptation/obligation. The Lovers card symbolizes 
the choices that must be made to progress and grow on the way 
to higher self-awareness; choices also reflect emotional 
values, indecisiveness, hesitation, our fears about making the 
wrong choice. This applies not only to love relationships and 
marriages, it is applicable to any relationship where people 
may be drawn together be it a business partnership or a casual, 
recreational one. The card of uncertainty!
