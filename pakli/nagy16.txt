The Devil

The card of the Devil represents the darker side 
of humankind, all that we is shameful and base and that we 
avoid to confront. Its imagery connects to sexuality, 
irrationality, obsession, and addiction. Being enslaved by our 
fears and desires we find it hard to let go of unhealthy 
relationships, addictive behavior, excessive attachment to 
material things, obsession with power. Accepting the shadowy 
side in us can help channel the energetic powers that this card 
also represents. Understanding, that the chains that tie us 
down can indeed be lifted by confronting our dark side, and not 
letting self-hatred and shame take over empowers us to be free. 
Qualities of this card in a negative situation include 
excessive ambition, rigidity, and abuse of power in the 
emotional as well as the material realm.
